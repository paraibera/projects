Here you can find some of my code. 

Currently there is nothing too fancy, my idea is to upload my local files and organize everything.

1. df_analyzer: quick analysis of simple dataframes, using histograms.
2. addition_algorithm: reproduces the paper/pen method for adding two numbers, helpful when teaching kids.
