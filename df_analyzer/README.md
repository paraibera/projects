This code helps me to quickly preview a dataframe, creating histograms for numeric columns.
As I usually work with too many columns, this is an efficient way to start my analysis.

How to:

1. Insert some .csv or .xlsx files into the /input directory. 
2. Run *main.py* and select a file.
3. You should see a summary for the file, and some histograms in /histograms.
